Input : Array
Keywords : maximum jump length (maximum operations) => Greedy
Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4 => O(n) , O(nlogn)
             0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5 

Intuition:
You track the farthest index you can reach from each index.
If at any point you can't move forward (i.e., i > maxIndex), return false.
If you can reach or exceed the last index, return true.

Key observation:
If array does not have any 0's, we can definitely reach the end.
If array has 0's then we just need to see if we can cross 0's index.

//TC = O(n)
//SC = O(1)

class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int maxIndex = 0; // max index that can be reached
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            // If the current index is greater than the maximum reachable index
            // it means we cannot move forward and should return false
            if (i > maxIndex) {
                return false;
            }

            // Update the maximum index that can be reached by comparing
            // the current maxIndex with the sum of the current index and the
            // maximum jump from that index
            maxIndex = Math.max(maxIndex, i + nums[i]); // i + nums[i] = max jump from i
        }

        // If we complete the loop,it means we did not return false and we can reach the last index
        return true;
    }
}
