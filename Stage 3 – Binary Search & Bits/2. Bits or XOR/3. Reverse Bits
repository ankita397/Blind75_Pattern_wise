Input : int
Keyword : bit => Bit manipulation
Constraints : 0 <= n <= 2^31 - 2 and n is even.

//TC = O(1)
//SC = O(1)
class Solution {
    public static int reverseBits(int n) {
        int result = 0;  // This will store the reversed bits
        
        // Loop through all 32 bits of the integer
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            
            // Step 1: Shift result left by 1 to make room for the next bit
            // We extract bits from right to left in n, but when building the reversed number,
            // we add bits from left to right in result. Shifting result left makes space 
            // on the right to add the next bit.
            result = result << 1;
            
            // Step 2: Extract the least significant bit (rightmost bit) of n
            // 'n & 1' gives us just the last bit of n (either 0 or 1).
            int lastBit = n & 1;
            
            // Step 3: Add this extracted bit into the rightmost position of result
            // We use bitwise OR to set the rightmost bit of result to lastBit without changing other bits.
            result = result | lastBit;
            
            // Step 4: Shift n right by 1 to move the next bit into the least significant position
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        
        // After 32 iterations, result contains all bits of n reversed
        return result;
